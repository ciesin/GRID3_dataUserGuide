## Examples:
- TOPST SCHOOL project: https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL-SPHINX/
  - Specific lesson: NRT Water Lesson: https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL-water/m102-lance-modis-nrt-global-flood.html
- Pytidycensus examples page: https://github.com/mmann1123/pytidycensus/tree/main/examples 
- NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook: https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/tutorials/
- GSAPP Smorgasbord: https://cdp.arch.columbia.edu/smorgasbord/modules/5-computational-design-modeling-in-grasshopper/5-7_Design-Space/

## Tips and Pointers
- Provide links to any relevant URLs including code packages, data documentation
- Provide links to other help/guides when relevant instead of DIY. For example, link to a guide on accessing REST APIs instead of writing a whole section yourself. Two options for this:
    - https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-use-api/#what 
    - https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.8/api/getting-started.html
- Use open source tools whenever possible to facilitate user accessibility. Where an open tool is not available, explain why the tool is necessary and point to some possible alternatives

# TO DO 
- Adapt Matt W's colab notebook that uses the roads dataset -> converts to a network -> calculates travel time 
  - Need to work out fix to access ArcGIS WMS in python

- Determine if we will use Astro or Quarto? -> Matt H. and Juan are doing some tests

- Map out which user guides we will develop next
  - Catchment areas from friction surface
  - DRC Data layers
  - Waterways
