# Welcome to the GRID3 Data Science User Guide!

This site is a **data science–focused user guide** for working with **GRID3 datasets**.
It combines Jupyter notebooks with structured documentationn.

The guide is intended for:
- Data scientists
- GIS analysts
- Researchers working with spatial data
- Python users working with APIs and feature services

---

# How this guide is organized



- **User Guides** → step-by-step notebooks  
- **Data Access** → APIs, Feature Services, metadata  
- **Visualization** → maps, plots, spatial workflows  
- **Reference** → reusable patterns and examples  

::: {.callout-note}
**Source of truth:**  
All examples are authored as **Jupyter notebooks** and rendered into this site using Quarto.
